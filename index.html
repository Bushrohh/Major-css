  <b>  My name is <b>Sekere Bushroh.</b>  I have always been a fan of technologies and it's entirety, right from secondary school <b>learning and reading computer has</b> always been fun. I started growing curious about how these tecnologies can make work easier, from there I became even more curious about how web pages and websites can look so <b>effective and responsive.</b>  There was a particular website I saw, it had animation and transition but back then I didin't even know what it was. it amazed me and even wanted me to learn more about it, I was not aconcictent person then, even now I'm still trying to beat it but it has gotten better. Started learning from youTube, didn't have  mentor so it was very hard but now i do have stutern that teaches people about their passion and what they love doing. <b>THANK YOU STUTERN!!!, I'LL FOREVER BE GRATEFUL ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY.</b>

         <b>   Beign in a class filled with thousands of people learning what they love. It has been a challenge learning with a lot of people but it also gives more knowledge about what you share with each other.CSS has been bit of a workload because of the different stylings we use, but now i have a better understanding of what different <b>stylings in CSS</b>  are, my team people have always been the best especially the team leader. My <b>best styling</b>  is external styling where we define everything in a particusr file and link it it to the html. <b>CSS is very important</b>  when building a website, <b>without it a website</b>  will be looking stuffy and unkept literally, everything jampacked without the right order.

         <b>  Border is the strip that goes around your div/element of the content. Padding is the space between the content and the border while margin is the space outside the border.
           <b>Content + Padding + Border + Margin = Total Space</b> </b>
